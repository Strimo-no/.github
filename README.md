## Analogy
1. **Customer (Frontend)**
 represents the user interface – what the user interacts with and sees.
2. **Waiter (Listener/Actions)**
 Listeners and Actions act as intermediaries, capturing events and inputs from the frontend and passing them to the core for processing. They also relay information back to the frontend.
3. **Cook (Core)**
 is the heart of the application, processing inputs, managing essential functionalities, and coordinating with the backend.
4. **Restaurant (Backend/User/Database)**
encompasses the entire backend infrastructure, including databases, servers, and other services. It also might represent the environment in which the core and frontend operate.
